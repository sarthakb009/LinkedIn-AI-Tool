](https://github.com/sarthakb009/LinkedIn-AI-Tool/issues/1#issue-2590977838)

This Chrome extension, designed using the **WXT framework**, streamlines LinkedIn messaging by automating the process of generating replies. It enables users to quickly craft and insert predefined responses directly within the LinkedIn interface, significantly reducing the time spent on repetitive messaging tasks.

## Key Features

- **Quick Reply Generator:** Offers users fast, pre-written responses based on their input, designed to fit common LinkedIn conversations.
- **Customizable Input:** Users can tailor responses by entering custom prompts to personalize their messages.
- **Integrated Edit Button:** Adds a user-friendly edit button to the LinkedIn message input area for easy access to the reply generator.
- **Direct Message Insertion:** Generated replies can be instantly placed into the LinkedIn message box with a single click.

## How It Operates

1. **Reply Generation Modal:**
   - When clicking inside LinkedIn's message input field, a small edit button appears.
   - Pressing the button opens a modal where the user can type a prompt to create a custom response.

2. **Generating Messages:**
   - After inputting a prompt, pressing the **Generate** button will produce a ready-to-use reply (currently using predefined templates but customizable for future updates).
   - The reply is displayed in the modal for review and editing if necessary.
   - By clicking **Insert**, the response is immediately added to the LinkedIn message field.

3. **Retry and Regenerate:**
   - Users can click **Regenerate** to produce a new response if the original isn't satisfactory, repeating this until they get the perfect message.

## Technology Stack

- **WXT Framework:** An efficient toolkit for building Chrome extensions.
- **TypeScript:** A type-safe version of JavaScript for enhanced coding productivity.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-focused CSS framework used for styling the user interface.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Core technologies for building interactive components and the UI. 

This extension offers a seamless experience for managing LinkedIn communications, helping professionals save time and engage more efficiently.
